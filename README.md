## IMPORTANT note for Debian `Trixie` users

> If you later update Debian to `Forky` or `SID` you **MUST** recompile Hyprland!!
> Run `update-hyprland.sh --install --with-deps`
> Reboot afterwards
> Failure to do so will prevent Hyprland from starting under `Forky` or `SID`
> It will return to the login manager

> [!IMPORTANT]
> install a backup tool like `snapper` or `timeshift`. and Backup your system before installing hyprland using this script (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**).

> [!CAUTION]
> Download this script on a directory where you have write permissions. ie. HOME. Or any directory within your home directory. Else script will fail

#### ⚠️ Pre-requisites and VERY Important

> Note: At this time `Kali` Linux is NOT supported.
> A number of users have reported issues installing and using the Dotfiles

- Do not run this installer with `sudo` or as `root`
- This Installer requires a user with a `sudo` privileges to install packages
- Debian 13 Trixie or greater. For the correct `GCC` compiler and libs
- Edit your APT sources (e.g. `/etc/apt/sources.list` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources`) and ensure `deb-src` is enabled (uncomment `#deb-src...` or change `Types: deb` to `Types: deb deb-src`) to enable source packaging else will not install properly especially Hyprland
- To easily do this
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
# OR
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
sudo apt update
```

- Delete `#` on the lines with `deb-src`
- Make sure to install `non-free` repository especially for users with NVIDIA GPUs. You can also install non-free drivers if required.
    - Edit `install-scripts/nvidia.sh` and change the NVIDIA settings if required


#### 🔔 NOTICE TO NVIDIA OWNERS

- KoolDots nvidia install script has been updated 
- It will offer you choice of drivers:
  - Debian repo, for older NVIDIA GPUs
  - CUDA closed drivers 
  - CUDA Open drivers
    - Current generation GPUs must choose the open drivers 
    - Overall the Open drivers are the better choice for supported GPUs 
- NVIDIA users / owners, after installation, check [`Notes For NVIDIA Users`](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Notes_to_remember#--for-nvidia-gpu-users)

#### ✨ Some notes on this installer / Prerequisites

- Recommend installing SDDM. Apart from GDM and SDDM, other Login Managers may not launch `Hyprland`.
    - Hyprland can be launched through tty by typing:
        - Prior to Hyprland v0.53.x `Hyprland` or `hyprland`
        - After Hyprland v0.53.x you must use `start-hyprland`
            - Otherwise will generate and error at start up.
            - You might need to update the login manager if not using SDDM or GDM
- 🕯️ network-manager-gnome (nm-applet) _has been removed_ from the packages to install. This is because it is known to restart the networkmanager causing issues in the installation process. After you boot up, inorder to get the network-manager applet, install network-manager-gnome. `sudo apt install network-manager-gnome` See below if your network or wifi became unmanaged after installation

### 🚩 changing login manager to SDDM

- if you really want to change login manager, there are couple of things you need to carry out before running this install script
- first install sddm. the no-install-recommends is suggested else it will pull lots of plasma depencies.

```bash
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends -y sddm
```

- then ran `sudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm` choose sddm and then reboot.
- once reboot done, you can ran the script and choose sddm & sddm theme
- [LINK](https://www.simplified.guide/ubuntu/switch-to-gdm) for some guide

#### 💫 SDDM and GTK Themes offered

- If you opted to install SDDM theme, here's the [LINK](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/simple-sddm-2) which is a modified fork of [LINK](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme)
- If you opted to install GTK Themes, Icons, here's the [LINK](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/GTK-themes-icons). This also includes Bibata Modern Ice cursor.

## ✨ Auto clone and install

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are using FISH SHELL, DO NOT use this function. Clone and run `install.sh` instead

- you can use this command to automatically clone the installer and ran the script for you
- NOTE: `curl` package is required before running this command

```bash

### 💥 UNINSTALL SCRIPT / Removal of Config Files

- 11 March 2025, due to popular request, created a guided `uninstall.sh` script. USE this with caution as it may render your system unstable.
- I will not be responsible if your system breaks
- The best still to revert to previous state of your system is via **timeshift or snapper**

#### 🤬 FAQ

**Most common question I got is, Hey Ja, Why the heck it is taking long time to install? Other distro like Arch its only a minute or two. Why here takes like forever?!?!?**

- Most of the core packages are downloaded, some have to be compiled from source.
    - Unlike Other distros, these packages already have prepacked binary that can just download and install.
    - This adds to the install time

## 🛎 **_DEBIAN Hyprland Dots UPDATING NOTES_**

- With this new update to Debian-Hyprland the current Hyprland-Dots are now compatible with Debian.

> [!NOTE]
> This script does not setup audio. Kindly set up. If you have not, I recommend pipewire. `sudo apt install -y pipewire`

#### 🙋 Got a questions regarding the Hyprland Dots or configurations? 🙋

Head over to wiki Link [`WIKI`](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/Hyprland-Dots/wiki)

#### ⌨ Keybinds

Keybinds [`CLICK`](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Keybinds)

> [!TIP]
> KooL Hyprland has a searchable keybind rofi menu. (`SUPER SHIFT K`) or right click the `HINTS` waybar button

#### 🙋 👋 Having issues or questions?

- for the install part, kindly open issue on this repo
- for the Pre-configured Hyprland dots / configuration, submit issue [`here`](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/Hyprland-Dots/issues)

#### 🔧 Proper way to re-installing a particular script from install-scripts directory

- CD into Debian-Hyprland directory and then ran the below command.
- i.e. `./install-scripts/gtk-themes.sh` - to reinstall GTK Themes or
- `./install-scripts/sddm.sh` - to reinstall sddm

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DO NOT CD into `install-scripts` directory to run any of those scripts
> The scripts are designed to ran outside `install-scripts` directory.
> If you do the scripts will fail.

#### 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] possibly adding gruvbox themes, cursors, icons

#### ❗ some known issues for nvidia

- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit to @Kenni Fix stated was

```
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to
)
```

- add `env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX` to the ENVvariables config `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf` ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to

- more info from the hyprland wiki [`Hyprland Wiki Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/FAQ/#my-external-monitor-is-blank--doesnt-render--receives-no-signal-laptop)

- reports from a member of discord for Nvidia for additional env's
- remove # from the following env's on

```
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm
env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE,1
```

#### 🫥 Improving performance for Older Nvidia Cards using driver 470

- [`SEE HERE`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/discussions/123#discussion-6035205)

#### ❗ other known issues

> [!NOTE]
> Auto start of Hyprland after login (no SDDM or GDM or any login managers)

- This was disabled a few days ago. (19 May 2024). This was because some users, after they used the Distro-Hyprland scripts with other DE (gnome-wayland or plasma-wayland), if they choose to login into gnome-wayland for example, Hyprland is starting.
- to avoid this, I disabled it. You can re-enable again by editing `~/.zprofile` . Remove all the # on the first lines
- [ ] ROFI issues (scaling, unexplained scaling etc). This is most likely to experience if you are installing on a system where rofi is currently installed. To fix it uninstall rofi and install rofi-wayland . `sudo apt autoremove rofi` .
- Install rofi-wayland with

```bash
cd ~/Debian-Hyprland
./install-scripts/rofi-wayland.sh
```

- [ ] Rofi-wayland is compatible with x11 so no need to worry.

- [ ] Does not work in Debian Bookworm
- [ ] sddm blackscreen when log-out
- [ ] Installing SDDM if or any other Login Manager installed. See [`Issue 2 - SDDM`](https://github.com/LinuxBeginnings/Debian-Hyprland/issues/2)
- [ ] network is down or become unmanaged [`This`](https://askubuntu.com/questions/71159/network-manager-says-device-not-managed) might help
